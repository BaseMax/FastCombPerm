**FastCombPerm: A Fast Package For Creating Combinations and Permutations With And Without Repetition**

## Fast Combinations and Permutations Calculator - version 1.0.0

Sometimes we need to find the list of all possible without spending time designing recursive or non-recursive algorithms to find permutations or combinations list. By using this software you can easily count and find the list of all items. We researched the algorithms for creating possible lists and finally implemented this software.
